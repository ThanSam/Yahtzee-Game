# Yahtzee Game
Yahtzee, a dice game implemented in Java 17.

The dice game <b>Yahtzee</b> is implemented in this project.
Yahtzee is played by rolling five dice. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn for each player to try to make certain scoring 
combinations. On the second and third throw of a round, a player can roll only the dice that don't have the numbers he's trying to get.
